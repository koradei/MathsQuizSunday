 +---------------+
-|Work Experience|-
 +---------------+

On this work experience I've learnt quite a lot of things that I've never known before. Before I didn't know how to anything in HTML, even though I am still not a pro at it I still learnt something that I can take away with me and hopefully develop it into an skill in the future. I could've improved on the website if I learnt how to do some more things that make the website much more reliable. But, for the first website I ever made fully with coding it I believe it's not bad, you can get make something pretty good with no knowledge and you'll get some knowledge out of it. I am proud of what I've done. I've done some things that I didn't think that I'd manage to do and I've got a lot further in this that I expected, I thought I wouldn't have been close to finishing the website but it's pretty much done.

 +----------+
-|New Skills|-
 +----------+

There are a few new skills that I've learnt, one of them is basic HTML that I never knew what to do and how to get started before. I also gained teamwork skill where I worked with everyone else, getting help and giving help, 

 +---------+
-|Making It|-
 +---------+

While I was making the website it took a while, there were a few things that I didn't understand and a few problems that normally appeared but I worked through it. If there was something that I couldn't do I just tried to find another way on how to do something similar and then I normally managed to do that getting it to work and all fit together.

 +-------+
-|Run App|-
 +-------+

You'll need to open Git Bash and enter the command 'npm i -g @angular/cli' which will install the angular onto your app. Then you'll create the project with the command 'ng new (name)' in name you'll enter what you want to call it for example, MathsQuiz. You'll follow the rest of the commands, loading it with 'ng serve' to live check.

 +---------+
-|Build App|-
 +---------+

Using the command 'ng build' on Git Bash creates a new folder (called dist) that has the local files on for your app which you can then deploy

 +----------+
-|Deploy App|-
 +----------+

Deploying the app was a bit simple, I had to create a Firebase account and do a few things, creating a new file, doing things like that ect. On the Git Bash it's really simple, all I had to do was login with the command 'firebase login' and finally 'firebase deploy'.

 +------------+
-|Make Changes|-
 +------------+

Making changes locally by using Git Bash and typing 'ng serve' to get it started and you can check the live updates by going to the localhost:4200 on your browser. Making changes on a hosted website is easy, all I did was save it in the Atom when I made a change and went back into the Git Bash, logged in and I typed thecommand 'firebase deploy' to get the hosted website updated once again, making it that simple.

 +-----------+
-|Improvement|-
 +-----------+
	
I could've made the website look a bit better than it is right now, maybe add a few more colours apart from the ones that I've chosen which are all a different tone of red, apart from the gif which has multiple colours. I could've also, instead of textbox answers, could've done multiple choice answers randomizing the order which the correct answer is each time. I could've made a button where the scoreboard appears on a click of that button so there won't be too much to look at, it looks good right now though.
	
 +-----+
-|Clone|-
 +-----+

I'll clone a git with the command 'git clone (link)' inside a Git Bash, wherever I opened that Git Bash, it'll create the folder from Git Hub straight to the destination. After, I'll do the command 'npm install' inside that folder that was just made so it'll have all of the correct items inside of it that were ignored with the '.ignoregit' file.
